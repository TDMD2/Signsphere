# SignSphere

**Breaking communication barriers across work, education, and entertainment platforms for deaf.**

With the rise of AI video generation and existing technologies like the YouTube API for transcription, SignSphere demonstrates how sign language translation can be brought to the mainstream, just like other languages. By bridging these technologies, we aim to make digital content universally accessible.

SignSphere is dedicated to making digital content truly inclusive. We believe that high-quality media plays a powerful role in development, and for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals, access to engaging visual content is especially important. Our goal is to bring sign language into media, bringing everyone into the story—one sign at a time.
